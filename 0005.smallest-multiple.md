# [5. Smallest Multiple](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

## Problem

$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible (divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from $1$ to $20$?

## Implementation

Python

```python
import functools

def factorial(n):
  return functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, range(1, n + 1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
  number = 0
  while number < factorial(20):
    number += 2520
    if all(number % i == 0 for i in range(2, 20)):
      break
  print(number)
```

## Result

```
232792560
```
