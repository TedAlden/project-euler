# [2. Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Implementation

Python

```python
def fibonacci(n):
  """
  Returns all fibonacci numbers upto c, starting with a and b
  """
  a, b = 0, 1
  while a + b < n:
    yield a + b
    a, b = b, a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
  total = 0
  for i in fibonacci(4000000):
    if i % 2 == 0:
      total += i
  print(total)
```

## Result

```
4613732
```
